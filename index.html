          accomplishments in chronological order:

            British oppression and land dispossession of the Kikuyu people.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1952:</strong> Kimathi becomes a leader in the Mau Mau
            movement, organizing resistance against the British colonial

            takes charge of the military wing of the Mau Mau, leading guerrilla
            warfare against British forces.

          <li>
            <strong>1957:</strong> British colonial forces capture Kimathi,
